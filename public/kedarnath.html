        <hr/>
        <p>Kedarnath is the most remote of the four Chota Char Dham pilgrimage sites.
             It is located in the Himalayas, about 3,583 m (11,755 ft) above sea level
              near the Chorabari Glacier, which is the source of the Mandakini river. 
            The town is flanked by snow-capped peaks, most prominently the Kedarnath Mountain.</p>
